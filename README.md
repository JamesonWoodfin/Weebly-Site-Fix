# Weebly-Site-Fix
I use Weebly to create/edit/update my website but I host my website on my own server. This repository is for scripts I use to fix my Weebly website after an export to speed up the update process. Also just wanted to practice using java. I'll add comments on how to edit the code to make this work for your Weebly site!
